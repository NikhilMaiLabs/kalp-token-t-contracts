The contracts implement a bonding curve token system with automatic graduation to Uniswap V2 DEX trading. Overall, the codebase demonstrates good security practices with proper use of OpenZeppelin libraries, reentrancy protection, and access controls. However, several critical and medium-severity issues were identified that require attention.

## Security Assessment: ⚠️ MEDIUM RISK

**Critical Issues:** 2  
**High Issues:** 1  
**Medium Issues:** 4  
**Low Issues:** 3

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. Graduation Process Vulnerability - No Rollback Mechanism
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**File:** `BondingCurveToken.sol:612-657`

**Issue:** The `_graduate()` function permanently marks the token as graduated before ensuring Uniswap operations succeed. If the Uniswap call fails, the token becomes permanently unusable.

```solidity
function _graduate() internal {
    hasGraduated = true;  // ❌ Set before external call
    // ... Uniswap operations that can fail
    router.addLiquidityETH{value: liquidityPolAmount}(...);
}
```

**Impact:** 
- Token becomes permanently graduated even if DEX operations fail
- Users lose access to bonding curve trading
- Funds may be locked in contract

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
function _graduate() internal {
    // Calculate amounts first
    uint256 currentSupply = totalSupply();
    uint256 liquidityTokenAmount = currentSupply;
    uint256 liquidityPolAmount = (totalRaised * LIQUIDITY_FEE) / 10000;
    
    // Create pair first
    address pair = uniswapV2Factory.getPair(address(this), router.WETH());
    if (pair == address(0)) {
        pair = uniswapV2Factory.createPair(address(this), router.WETH());
    }
    
    // Mint tokens for liquidity
    _mint(address(this), liquidityTokenAmount);
    _approve(address(this), address(router), liquidityTokenAmount);
    
    // Try Uniswap operation
    try router.addLiquidityETH{value: liquidityPolAmount}(...) {
        // Only mark as graduated if successful
        hasGraduated = true;
        dexPool = pair;
        // ... rest of logic
    } catch {
        // Revert state changes
        _burn(address(this), liquidityTokenAmount);
        revert("Graduation failed");
    }
}
```

### 2. Potential Integer Overflow in Pricing Calculations
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**File:** `BondingCurveToken.sol:308-378`

**Issue:** While Solidity 0.8+ has built-in overflow protection, the mathematical operations in pricing functions could still cause issues with very large numbers.

```solidity
function getCurrentPrice() public view returns (uint256 currentPrice) {
    return basePrice + (slope * totalSupply());  // Potential overflow
}

function getBuyPrice(uint256 amount) public view returns (uint256 totalCost) {
    totalCost = basePrice * amount + 
                slope * currentSupply * amount + 
                slope * amount * (amount - 1) / 2;  // Multiple overflow points
}
```

**Impact:**
- Incorrect pricing calculations
- Potential for economic exploitation
- Contract state corruption

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol";

function getCurrentPrice() public view returns (uint256 currentPrice) {
    return basePrice + (slope * totalSupply());
}

function getBuyPrice(uint256 amount) public view returns (uint256 totalCost) {
    require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
    
    uint256 currentSupply = totalSupply();
    
    // Use SafeMath for critical calculations
    uint256 term1 = basePrice * amount;
    uint256 term2 = slope * currentSupply * amount;
    uint256 term3 = slope * amount * (amount - 1) / 2;
    
    totalCost = term1 + term2 + term3;
    return totalCost;
}
```

## 🟠 HIGH ISSUES

### 3. Missing Slippage Protection in Graduation
**Severity:** HIGH  
**File:** `BondingCurveToken.sol:639-646`

**Issue:** The graduation process uses fixed 5% slippage tolerance without considering market conditions or MEV attacks.

```solidity
(uint amountToken, uint amountETH, uint liquidity) = router.addLiquidityETH{value: liquidityPolAmount}(
    address(this),
    liquidityTokenAmount,
    liquidityTokenAmount * 95 / 100,  // Fixed 5% slippage
    liquidityPolAmount * 95 / 100,    // Fixed 5% slippage
    address(this),
    block.timestamp + 300
);
```

**Impact:**
- MEV attacks during graduation
- Unfavorable price execution
- Loss of funds due to slippage

**Recommendation:**
- Implement dynamic slippage based on market conditions
- Add deadline validation
- Consider using TWAP for price discovery

---

## 🟡 MEDIUM ISSUES

### 4. Centralized Control Over Token Parameters
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**File:** `TokenFactory.sol:637-640`

**Issue:** Factory owner can update trading fees on existing tokens, potentially affecting users who bought tokens under different fee structures.

```solidity
function updateTradingFeesOnExistingToken(address token, uint256 newBuyTradingFee, uint256 newSellTradingFee) external onlyOwner validTokenAddress(token) {
    BondingCurveToken tokenContract = BondingCurveToken(payable(token));
    tokenContract.updateTradingFees(newBuyTradingFee, newSellTradingFee);
}
```

**Impact:**
- Breaks user expectations
- Potential for rug pulls
- Unfair advantage to factory owner

**Recommendation:**
- Implement time-locked changes
- Require community governance for fee changes
- Add maximum fee change limits

### 5. Emergency Graduation Function
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**File:** `TokenFactory.sol:694-710`

**Issue:** Factory owner can force graduation of any token, bypassing economic incentives.

```solidity
function triggerGraduation(address token) external onlyOwner validTokenAddress(token) {
    BondingCurveToken tokenContract = BondingCurveToken(payable(token));
    tokenContract.triggerGraduation();
    // ...
}
```

**Impact:**
- Centralized control over token lifecycle
- Potential for market manipulation
- Unfair advantage to factory owner

**Recommendation:**
- Remove or restrict to emergency use only
- Add time delays and community notification
- Implement multi-sig requirements

### 6. Missing Input Validation in Blacklist
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**File:** `Blacklist.sol:28-40`

**Issue:** The blacklist functions don't validate input addresses properly.

```solidity
function _blockAccount (address _account) internal virtual {
    require(!_isBlackListed[_account], "Blacklist: Account is already blocked");
    _isBlackListed[_account] = true;
    emit BlockedAccount(_account);
}
```

**Impact:**
- Potential for blocking zero address
- No validation of contract vs EOA
- Missing event validation

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
function _blockAccount (address _account) internal virtual {
    require(_account != address(0), "Cannot block zero address");
    require(!_isBlackListed[_account], "Blacklist: Account is already blocked");
    _isBlackListed[_account] = true;
    emit BlockedAccount(_account);
}
```

### 7. Insufficient Balance Check in Sell Function
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**File:** `BondingCurveToken.sol:547`

**Issue:** The sell function only checks if contract has enough balance for the refund, but doesn't account for potential rounding errors or edge cases.

```solidity
require(address(this).balance >= refund, "Insufficient contract balance");
```

**Impact:**
- Potential for failed transactions due to rounding
- User experience issues
- Gas waste

**Recommendation:**
- Add buffer for rounding errors
- Implement more robust balance management
- Consider using SafeMath for all calculations

---

## 🟢 LOW ISSUES

### 8. Missing Events in Critical Functions
**Severity:** LOW  
**File:** Multiple locations

**Issue:** Some critical state changes don't emit events, making it difficult to track contract state.

**Recommendation:**
- Add events for all state changes
- Include relevant parameters in events
- Ensure events are indexed properly

### 9. Hardcoded Values
**Severity:** LOW  
**File:** `BondingCurveToken.sol:645`

**Issue:** Hardcoded deadline of 5 minutes may not be suitable for all network conditions.

```solidity
block.timestamp + 300  // 5 minutes
```

**Recommendation:**
- Make deadline configurable
- Consider network congestion
- Add validation for reasonable ranges

### 10. Missing NatSpec Documentation
**Severity:** LOW  
**File:** Multiple locations

**Issue:** Some functions lack comprehensive documentation.

**Recommendation:**
- Add complete NatSpec documentation
- Include examples for complex functions
- Document all parameters and return values
